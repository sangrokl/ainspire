Current CEP panel UI inside Premiere Pro, using the refreshed bridge controls and status layout.

## Current Status

This repository is currently validated for:

- macOS
- Adobe Premiere Pro 2020+ (actively used and tested on Premiere Pro 26.0)
- Node.js 18+
- the included macOS installer path for Claude Desktop
- manual MCP registration for Codex, Claude Code, and similar MCP clients

Current local validation as of March 4, 2026:

- `97` tools are exposed
- `43` tools were live-executed against a real Premiere session
- `50` tools were schema-validated in the same sweep
- `3` destructive no-arg tools were intentionally skipped (`save_project`, `undo`, `consolidate_duplicates`)
- `1` live runtime limitation remains: `get_render_queue_status` requires Adobe Media Encoder integration

The full live sweep output is written to `/tmp/premiere-mcp-bridge/live-tool-sweep.json` when you run the verifier.

## What You Get

The server covers project operations, ingest, sequence creation, timeline editing, transitions, effects, keyframes, metadata, exports, and higher-level assembly workflows.

Example prompts:

- "List all sequences and show me which one is active."
- "Import these three shots and build a rough product spot."
- "Add cross dissolves to every cut on video track 1."
- "Apply Gaussian Blur to the middle clip."
- "Razor the interview sequence at 12.5 seconds across all audio and video tracks."
- "Export the active sequence as FCP XML."

Before editing, you can also attach the `premiere://config/get_instructions` resource to give the model Premiere-specific operating guidance.

High-level workflow tools included:

- `build_motion_graphics_demo`
- `assemble_product_spot`
- `build_brand_spot_from_mogrt_and_assets`

`assemble_product_spot` and `build_brand_spot_from_mogrt_and_assets` now support an optional `clipPlan` argument so an LLM can direct per-clip timing, track placement, transitions, motion, trims, effects, and color adjustments instead of relying on fixed template defaults.

## Fastest Install (macOS)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hetpatel-11/Adobe_Premiere_Pro_MCP.git
cd Adobe_Premiere_Pro_MCP
npm run setup:mac
```

That installer will:

- install dependencies
- build `dist/index.js`
- enable Adobe CEP debug mode
- install the `MCP Bridge (CEP)` extension
- create `/tmp/premiere-mcp-bridge`
- add the `premiere-pro` MCP entry to Claude Desktop

Important:

- the supported UI bridge in this repo is the `MCP Bridge (CEP)` extension
- the installer enables Adobe **CEP** debug mode automatically
- if Premiere does not expose the extension cleanly on your machine, enable **UXP Plugins > Enable developer mode** in Premiere Pro preferences before opening the bridge panel
- `npm run setup:mac` is the easiest path for Claude Desktop on macOS because it updates Claude Desktop config automatically

After the installer finishes:

1. Quit and reopen your MCP client if it reads config on startup. If you used the installer, that means Claude Desktop.
2. Quit and reopen Premiere Pro.
3. In Premiere Pro on macOS, open `Premiere Pro > Preferences > Plugins` and enable **UXP Plugins > Enable developer mode**.
4. Restart Premiere Pro if the setting was changed.
5. Open `Window > Extensions > MCP Bridge (CEP)`.
6. Set `Temp Directory` to `/tmp/premiere-mcp-bridge`.
7. Click `Save Configuration`.
8. Click `Start Bridge`.
9. Click `Test Connection`.
10. If `Test Connection` fails, click `Run Diagnostics` and send back `/tmp/premiere-mcp-bridge/premiere-mcp-diagnostics-latest.json`.

If you need a visual reference for the developer mode toggle, it looks like this:

If the panel reports that Premiere is ready, the bridge is live.

## Install By Client

### Claude Desktop

On macOS, use:

```bash
npm run setup:mac
```

That is the only path in this repo that automatically writes the MCP entry for you.

### Codex

Build the server first:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Then add the MCP server on a single line:

```bash
codex mcp add premiere_pro --env PREMIERE_TEMP_DIR=/tmp/premiere-mcp-bridge -- node /absolute/path/to/Adobe_Premiere_Pro_MCP/dist/index.js
```

### Claude Code

Build the server the same way:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Then register the MCP server in Claude Code using the same built `dist/index.js` entrypoint and the same temp directory:

```text
command: node /absolute/path/to/Adobe_Premiere_Pro_MCP/dist/index.js
env: PREMIERE_TEMP_DIR=/tmp/premiere-mcp-bridge
```

If you use a local MCP config file instead of a helper command, point it at the same `dist/index.js` and set the same env var.

### Other MCP Clients

Use the same manual registration approach as Claude Code:

```text
command: node /absolute/path/to/Adobe_Premiere_Pro_MCP/dist/index.js
env: PREMIERE_TEMP_DIR=/tmp/premiere-mcp-bridge
```

Important for all manual client setups:

- keep the command on one line
- use the real absolute path to `dist/index.js`
- restart the client after adding or updating the MCP entry
- start the CEP bridge inside Premiere and confirm the temp directory is exactly `/tmp/premiere-mcp-bridge`

## Verify the Install

Run the built-in checks:

```bash
npm run setup:doctor
```

That validates:

- Node.js version
- built server output
- CEP extension install
- `/tmp/premiere-mcp-bridge`
- Adobe CEP debug mode
- the Claude Desktop config entry when you use the installer path
- CEP panel diagnostics written to `/tmp/premiere-mcp-bridge/premiere-mcp-diagnostics-latest.json`

For a deeper end-to-end check, use a disposable Premiere project and run:

```bash
node scripts/live-tool-sweep.mjs
```

This creates temporary `Sweep ...` sequences in the currently open project so the toolchain is exercised against real data.

## How the Bridge Works

```text
+-----------+        +-----------+        +-----------+
|  Client   |  MCP   | Node.js   | Files  | CEP Panel |
| (Codex+)  |<------>| MCP Server|<------>| (Premiere)|
+-----------+        +-----------+        +-----------+
                                                 |
                                                 v
                                          +-----------+
                                          | Premiere  |
                                          | DOM / QE  |
                                          +-----------+
```

1. The client calls an MCP tool.
2. The Node server generates ExtendScript plus shared helpers.
3. The script is written into `/tmp/premiere-mcp-bridge`.
4. The CEP panel polls that directory and runs the script through `CSInterface.evalScript()`.
5. The panel writes the result back to the response file.
6. The server returns structured JSON to the MCP client.

## Tool Coverage

The `97` exposed tools are grouped roughly like this:

- Discovery and project inspection
- Project and sequence management
- Media import and bin management
- Timeline placement and clip operations
- Effects, transitions, color, and keyframes
- Markers, metadata, labels, and work-area control
- Export and interchange helpers
- MOGRT, captions, proxies, and relink helpers
- High-level ad / promo assembly workflows

Use MCP introspection in your client to see the full tool catalog and exact schemas.

## Real Limits

This project is much more usable than the original prototype, but it is not magic.

- Premiere scripting still does not expose every UI operation cleanly.
- Professional title design still depends on real MOGRT assets or external graphics workflows.
- `get_render_queue_status` is only useful when Adobe Media Encoder integration is available.
- The best results come from real source footage, real audio, and real brand assets. The automation layer assembles and manipulates them; it does not replace editorial judgment.

## Troubleshooting

If the tools are visible but calls fail:

1. Confirm Premiere Pro is open with a project loaded.
2. Open `Window > Extensions > MCP Bridge (CEP)`.
3. Confirm the temp directory is exactly `/tmp/premiere-mcp-bridge`.
4. Click `Start Bridge`.
5. If you updated the bridge code, right-click the panel and choose `Reload`.
6. Retry the command.

If the MCP client cannot find the server:

1. Verify the absolute path to `dist/index.js`.
2. Verify `PREMIERE_TEMP_DIR=/tmp/premiere-mcp-bridge`.
3. Restart the MCP client after changing config.
4. Run `npm run setup:doctor`.

## Developer Notes

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run build
npm test -- --runInBand
npm run setup:doctor
node scripts/live-tool-sweep.mjs
```
